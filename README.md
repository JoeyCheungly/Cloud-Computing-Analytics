# US Airline Passengersâ€™ Satisfaction Analytics

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud-based application and analytics GitHub repository! This repository contains an application that aims at conducting Machine Learning tasks via Spark MLlib for feature importance detection, customer segmentation and building classification models regarding the satisfaction and flight classes of airline passengers in the United States. 

## Dataset

Klein, T. (2020, February 20). Airline passenger satisfaction. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data 

## Folders: 

`MLlib`: To be uploaded to GCP VM, contains docker-compose file (docker-compose_hdfs_spark.yml), Hadoop environment file (hadoop.env) and a nbs folder 

`MLlib/nbs`: Two datasets (train.csv, test.csv), jupyter notebook for spark implementation (47633542.ipynb)


## Usage Commands 

1. Upload MLlib zip file and unzip it 
unzip MLlib.zip

2. Create and change directory to proj 
mkdir $HOME/proj && cd $HOME/proj

3. Move folder to proj directory
mv $HOME/MLlib/* $HOME/proj/


4. Run the docker-compose file to pull images and run all containers
sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose_hdfs_spark.yml up -d


5. Find the container id of the namenode
sudo docker ps


6. Log into the namenode container 
sudo docker exec -it container_id bash


7. Transfer local files from nbs folder to HDFS
hdfs dfs -put /home/nbs/train.csv /
hdfs dfs -put /home/nbs/test.csv /


8. Display all directories and files to check if transfer is successful 
hdfs dfs -ls /


9. Exit the namenode 
exit


10. (Optional) Set permission 
sudo chmod -R 777 $HOME/proj/nbs

11. Go to EXTERNAL_IP:8888 to access jupyter notebook
